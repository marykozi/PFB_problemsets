Kirill by Shel Silverstein

Kirill loves me,
Kirill cares,
Kirill picks me peaches and pears.
Kirill offers me candy and Cokes,
Kirill listens and laughs at me jokes.
Kirill helps when I get in a fight,
Kirill does all my homework at night.
Kirill misses me,
Kirill cries,
Kirill thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Kirill is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Kirill just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Kirill's hand,
In the darkness where Kirill usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Kirill's gone!
